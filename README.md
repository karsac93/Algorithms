Implementation of algorithms in python

1. min_heap.py - An algorithm with run time of O(n log n) to merge k-sorted list into one sorted list, where n is the total number of elements in all the input lists
2. vertex_cover.py - An algorithm with run time of O(n) to find an optimal vertex cover in a free tree using DFS
